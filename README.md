# Progress Bar with Increment/Decrement Controls
This project demonstrates how to create a progress bar in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the progress value can be increased or decreased by clicking two separate buttons. The progress value is constrained between 0 and 150, and the current value is displayed in an <h1> element.

# Features
Dynamic Progress Bar: The progress bar visually represents the current value, adjusting its width accordingly.
Value Display: The current value of the progress bar is displayed in an h1 element above the bar.
Button Controls: Two buttons allow users to increase or decrease the progress value by 1 unit.
Value Constraints: The progress value is constrained between 0 and 150.

# Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the progress bar and control buttons.
CSS: For styling the progress bar, container, and buttons.
JavaScript: For handling the logic to update the progress bar and display the current value.
# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have a web browser installed (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

# Code Explanation
HTML (index.html)
The structure includes an h1 element to display the current value, a progress container with a progress bar, and two buttons for increasing and decreasing the progress value.
CSS (styles.css)
The progress container and bar are styled to provide a clean, responsive appearance. The bar changes width smoothly when updated.
JavaScript (script.js)
JavaScript handles the logic to adjust the progress value based on button clicks, updates the progress bar's width, and displays the current value in the h1 element.
